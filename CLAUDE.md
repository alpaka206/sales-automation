# Project Context

PERSO Inbound is a FastAPI workflow for inbound inquiry handling and customer operations.

## Invariants

- **Pre-launch safety (대전제, top priority).** `LIVE_EXTERNAL_WRITES` defaults to `false` (SAFE). While safe: every HubSpot write is hard-blocked (`guard_external_write` → `ExternalWriteBlocked`), Google Sheets writes are disabled (`writes_enabled()`), and every outbound email is force-routed to `ronald@estsoft.com` (`resolve_send_override`) — a customer can never be emailed even if `SEND_OVERRIDE_EMAIL` is cleared. Reads stay on. Enforced in `src/common/safe_mode.py`; guaranteed behavior is pinned by `tests/test_safe_mode.py`. Any NEW external-write/send path MUST call `guard_external_write` (or route through `resolve_send_override`) and add a line to `tests/test_safe_mode.py`. **Go-live = set `LIVE_EXTERNAL_WRITES=true` AND clear `SEND_OVERRIDE_EMAIL`.**
- **Per-destination switches are subordinate.** `LIVE_HUBSPOT_WRITES` / `LIVE_SHEETS_WRITES` (both default `true`) select which destinations go live *after* the master is on; neither can permit a write while `LIVE_EXTERNAL_WRITES` is `false`. `guard_external_write("<channel>:<action>")` picks the gate from the label prefix, and an unregistered channel falls back to the master — so a new write path is blocked by default.
- HubSpot tickets are accepted only from `HUBSPOT_TICKET_STAGE_NEW` when a ticket ID exists.
- The first receipt acknowledgement may send automatically; the detailed reply always requires human approval.
- SMTP performs real delivery. HubSpot's CRM email object is used only to log a successful delivery.
- Slack approval notifications are emitted only after a detailed draft is ready.
- `Message.direction` uses `inbound` for received messages and `outgoing` for our replies.
- Personal email domains are never grouped as one company.
- Existing conversation progress rows are append-only.

## Stack

- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Jinja/HTMX
- Gemini on Vertex AI (`flash` for routing/classification, `pro` for customer replies)
- SQLite locally; PostgreSQL-compatible migrations
- SMTP delivery, HubSpot CRM synchronization, optional Slack

## Data flow

`HubSpot webhook / 10-minute poll → immediate acknowledgement → Gemini + policy docs → review queue + Slack → SMTP → HubSpot timeline + ticket stage`

Customer operations reuse the same Contact and Conversation records. `CustomerProfile`, `CustomerInteraction`, and `ContractRecord` add manual pipeline fields, cross-channel history, contracts, payments, and renewal insights without duplicating the inbound pipeline.

## Development

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.db.migrate
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check src tests
```

Do not send live messages in tests. `tests/conftest.py` disables background integrations regardless of the developer `.env`.
